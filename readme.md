## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adnan-The-Coder/zero-day-codebase.git
```

### 2. Install `pnpm`

`pnpm` is the package manager used for managing dependencies in this repository. To install `pnpm`, follow the steps below based on your operating system:

#### For macOS or Linux:

You can install `pnpm` globally using **Homebrew** (macOS) or **npm** (Linux/macOS):

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

#### For Windows:

You can install `pnpm` using **npm** via the command prompt:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

If you encounter any issues with the installation, refer to the [official pnpm documentation](https://pnpm.io/installation).

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once `pnpm` is installed, navigate to the root directory of the project (where the `package.json` is located) and run the following command to install all the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will install the necessary packages for both the `web` UI and any other internal libraries or applications.

---

## Running the Web UI

The project contains a `web` application built using **Next.js**. To run the application, follow these steps:

### 1. Run the Web UI Locally

To start the `web` application locally, use the following command:

```bash
nx serve web
```

This will start the development server on a local machine and you can access the application in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If port 3000 is already in use, it will automatically use the next available port (e.g., 3001).

### 2. What Happens in the `web` Application

The `web` application is built using **Next.js**, a React framework, and is designed to be used as the user interface of this project. Any changes made within the `web` directory will trigger rebuilding the project and potentially redeploying the application to **Cloudflare Workers**.

---

## Deployment to Cloudflare Workers

The `web` application is also deployed to **Cloudflare Workers**. This deployment happens automatically when changes are made inside the `web` folder.

### 1. Deployment Flow

* Changes made within the `apps/web` folder will trigger a deployment to **Cloudflare Workers**. This is managed by **OpenNext** scripts written with pnpm run build and pnpm  run deploy, through CD pipeline using Cloudflare accont ID and API token.
* Every time you run the `nx serve web` command and changes are made, the build will trigger the deployment process to Cloudflare Workers, ensuring the latest version is always live.

---

## General Nx Commands

Nx provides several commands for managing your monorepo, including tasks like running, building, testing, and linting applications and libraries.

### 1. `nx serve <project>`

Starts the development server for a given project (e.g., `web`).

```bash
nx serve web
```

This will start the development server for the `web` project, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port).

### 2. `nx build <project>`

Builds the project and compiles the code.

```bash
nx build web
```

This command will build the `web` project and output the compiled code to the `dist/` folder, which is ready for deployment.

### 3. `nx lint <project>`

Runs linting checks on the specified project.

```bash
nx lint web
```

This will check the `web` project for linting errors, and output any issues found.

### 4. `nx test <project>`

Runs unit tests for a given project.

```bash
nx test web
```

This will run the unit tests for the `web` project and show the results in the terminal.

### 5. `nx affected:build`

Builds the affected projects based on the changes made to the workspace.

```bash
nx affected:build --base=main --head=HEAD
```

This will only build projects that were affected by the changes between the `main` branch and the current branch.

### 6. `nx run-many`

Run a target (e.g., build, test, lint) for multiple projects at once.

```bash
nx run-many --target=build --projects=web,other-app
```

This command allows you to run the `build` target for both the `web` project and another app in the workspace.

### 7. `nx migrate`

Upgrade the Nx workspace and its dependencies to the latest version.

```bash
nx migrate latest
```

This will migrate your workspace to the latest Nx version, making sure everything is up-to-date.
